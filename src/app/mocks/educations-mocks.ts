    title: 'History Of HIV',
    excerpt: 'Although researchers have traced the origins of HIV as far back as the 1930\'s, the first diagnosis of AIDS was not made until 1981. The first Canadian death due to AIDS was in 1983, and approximately 21,000 people in Canada',
    details: `Although researchers have traced the origins of HIV as far back as the 1930's, the first diagnosis of AIDS was not made until 1981. The first Canadian death due to AIDS was in 1983, and approximately 21,000 people in Canada have since died while infected with HIV. 

    At first, HIV mostly affected gay men and people infected through blood transfusions. The face of HIV/AIDS has changed dramatically in Canada over the past quarter century. Although men who have sex with men continue to be most affected by HIV/AIDS in Canada, HIV in Saskatchewan has also become a significant public health issue for injecting drug users, women, Aboriginal peoples, prison inmates, people from countries where HIV is endemic, as well as those already living with HIV/AIDS. Risk behaviour data on young Canadians also show significant potential for HIV transmission among youth.
    
    Through the combined efforts of many collaborators - governments, people living with HIV/AIDS, populations affected by the epidemic, civil society, professionals working in health care, education and social and legal services, researchers and the private sector - Canada can point to a number of important successes during the past two decades.
    
    For example, mother-to-child transmission of HIV has been nearly eliminated in Canada. The progress of the epidemic has been slowed recently among certain populations (e.g. injection drug users), and treatment advances have prolonged and improved the quality of life of many Canadians living with HIV. Canada's blood system has been made as safe as possible from contamination by HIV and other infectious diseases, and steps have been taken to increase public awareness about HIV/AIDS and to tackle social stigma and discrimination around HIV infection.
    
    Nevertheless, the epidemic continues to grow in Canada, taking a tragic and unnecessary toll on some of the most marginalized populations in the country. Until a safe and effective vaccine is developed for HIV, and a cure is found that can fully rid the body of the HIV virus, HIV/AIDS will remain a public health concern for all Canadians.`

    details: `HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus

    HIV is a virus that attacks your immune system. Your immune system is your body’s built-in defense against diseases. Although your immune system is supposed to protect you from infections, HIV can sneak past it. HIV then attacks your immune system from the inside. Without HIV treatment, your immune system can become too weak to fight off serious illnesses. HIV can also damage other parts of your body. Eventually, you can become sick with life-threatening infections. These are called “opportunistic infections”, meaning they take the opportunity to infect a weak immune system. This is the most serious stage of HIV infection, called AIDS. 
    
    HOW IS HIV TRANSMITTED?
    HIV is transmitted through direct contact with the blood or body fluid of someone who is infected with the virus. HIV infections happen when enough HIV from an HIV positive person gets into an HIV negative person’s body.
    
    Only 5 body fluids can contain enough viruses to infect someone else:
    
           Blood
           Semen (including pre-cum)
           Vaginal Fluid
           Anal Fluid
           Breast Milk
    
    HIGH RISK Activities:
    
    1.      Unprotected sex (oral, anal, vaginal)
    
    2.      Sharing used needles (this includes tattoo and body piercing equipment)
    
    3.      During child birth and breast feeding (from an HIV positive mother to her child)
    
    You CANNOT get HIV from:
    Hugs, kisses, casual contact
    coughs or sneezes
    Swimming pools
    toilet seats, fountains
    Towels or bed sheets
    Forks, spoons, cups, food
    Insect or animal bites
    SIGNS & SYMPTOMS
    Often people who are newly HIV infected have few or no symptoms. Other times, symptoms of HIV are confused with other illnesses such as the flu. If a person were to have symptoms they would include:
    Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, groin or under the arms 
    Diarrhea 
    Unexplained weight loss 
    Fatigue 
    Fever, chills or sweats (especially at night) 
    Frequent pneumonia's or shortness of breath 
    Rash 
    Flu-like symptoms ​
    Across Canada 1 in 5 people living with HIV have not been diagnosed.
    
    ​The only way to know for sure is to GET TESTED!
    
    ***You need to wait 3 months from last exposure to have accurate results***

    HIV TREATMENT
    There is no cure for HIV, but with proper care and treatment, most people with HIV can avoid getting AIDS and live a long and healthy life. Anti-HIV drugs have to be taken every day. 
    AIDS
    AIDS stands for Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome
    
    HIV and AIDS are not the same thing!​
    
    When the body is no longer able to fight off disease, opportunistic infections such as pneumonia and cancer take over the body. This is known as AIDS and is a disease caused by HIV.
    
    You can have HIV and live your whole life and not get AIDS.`

    title: 'Hepatitis C Basics',
    excerpt: 'Hepatitis C is a virus that is carried in the blood and infects the liver. This causes inflammation and scarring of the liver. Hep C is particularly strong and often resists your body’s defenses but treatment is available to help your body fight the virus.',
    details: `Hepatitis C is a virus that is carried in the blood and infects the liver. This causes inflammation and scarring of the liver. Hep C is particularly strong and often resists your body’s defenses but treatment is available to help your body fight the virus.

    Hep C targets your liver. The liver has many essential functions:
    Cleansing the blood
    Controlling how your body uses the energy you get from food
    Making some building blocks of the immune system
    Helping the blood to clot
    
    YOU CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOUR LIVER!
    HOW IS HEPATITIS C TRANSMITTED?
    BLOOD TO BLOOD CONTACT ONLY
    
    HIGH RISK Activities
    Sharing drug injection equipment – needles, spoons, water, filters, etc.
    Snorting drugs and sharing the same straw (sore in the nose)
    Sharing a pipe to smoke drugs (sores on the lips)
    Sharing toothbrushes (may be traces of blood)
    Sharing a razor (may be traces of blood)
    Sharing nail clippers (may be traces of blood)
    Spread by sex if there is blood involved (including menstrual blood)
    Sharing piercing or tattooing equipment, including ink
    
    Hep C virus can live from 16 hours to 4 days outside of the body and in the air. It can also live up to 9 weeks in a needle. Bleach has not been proven to kill it.
    SIGNS & SYMPTOMS
    ​Many people don’t have symptoms for years.
    
    As the disease progresses, an infected person might start to feel symptoms like:
    Tiredness all the time
    Body aches
    Dry, itchy skin
    “brain fog” (difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, confusion)
    Or a noticeable yellowing of skin and eyes (called Jaundice)
    Across Canada 1 in 5 people have Hepatitis C and do not know it.

    TREATMENT
    There are six different strains, or types, of Hep C, called genotypes. Knowing the genotype of your virus is important because some genotypes react better to some treatments than to others. It is possible to become infected with more than one genotype after multiple exposures to Hep C. This can make treatment more difficult.
    
    The best treatment for Hep C is:
    Eat a balanced diet
    Follow safer sex and drug practices
    Consider medication (Medication may need to be taken from 6 months to 1 year, depending on the type of Hep C Virus)
    If the virus has been “cleared” (as shown by no evidence of the virus in blood samples) then treatment was successful!`

    excerpt: 'Condoms: A new condom should be used every time you have sexual intercourse. From the moment the penis comes in contact with the vagina, anus, or mouth, until there is no more contact.',
    details: `Condoms:
    A new condom should be used every time you have sexual intercourse. From the moment the penis comes in contact with the vagina, anus, or mouth, until there is no more contact.
    Carefully unwrap the condom checking to make sure it is not damaged.
    Unroll the condom all the way to the base of the penis
    Pinch the air out of the tip and make sure there are no air bubbles caught in the condom (these may cause a break)
    Leave a space at the end of the condom as a reservoir
    Use water-based lubricant to prevent breakage (oil-based lubes can cause a condom to break)
    When you have finished having sex, withdraw before the penis becomes soft, holding the base of the condom
    Never reuse a condom
    
    ﻿Common Condom Use Mistakes﻿
    
    Unrolling a condom before putting it on
    No space at the tip
    Reusing a condom
    Putting on two condoms at once
    Wrong size condom
    Not removing the air from the tip
    Improper storage
    Wrong lubricant
    
    Dental Dams:
    
    For oral sex performed on the vulva or anus. Dental dams can be made from unrolling a condom, cutting the tip off and cutting down the side. `
